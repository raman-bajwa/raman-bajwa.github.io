</p><p id="17548da9-de24-8077-9d4b-d5db14798504" class="">As Web development frameworks are evolving it is more important than ever to develop a web app that is easy to scale, maintain and Upgrade. Following best practices from the first line of code, sets the foundation for a good codebase that you and your team can collaborate on. Here are the few practices that I follow to build robust and scalable web apps: </p><h1 id="17348da9-de24-80ed-955b-d7b27821576c" class="">TypeScript </h1><p id="17548da9-de24-8076-99b4-df50de29f70a" class="">If you are developing your project in react or any JS based framework, you must use TypeScript instead of JavaScript, because it’ll help you to manage complexity and long-term sustainability. It reduces runtime errors by catching typo early in the development phase. TypeScript supports Interfaces, Abstract classes, Inheritance and Access modifiers to help you leverage Object-Oriented features in your project.</p><h1 id="17548da9-de24-80b0-9623-efbacbfcd633" class="">Use linting </h1><p id="17548da9-de24-8042-ab6a-f6b8023e3861" class="">Use your preferred styling option as it’ll help you to write clean and consistent code throughout your project. There are couple of linter for JavaScript like ESLint and JSLint. ESLint provides a variety of customizations to tailor it to your own needs and preferences.</p><h1 id="17548da9-de24-8093-b8e3-c12456d4018f" class="">TDD(Test Driven Development)</h1><p id="17548da9-de24-8053-9827-fc2157a1ddfb" class="">It is a development practice that, In which automated tests are written before the actual code that needs to be tested. It may feel time-consuming in the early days of web development, but as your codebase grows and you want to refactor or optimize your code, it provides the peace of mind that the refactored code will not break anything and will not introduce any unintentional behavior. So it is a good practice to write test cases before you write your actual code, it will help you identify the edge cases, where the code may fail.</p><h1 id="17348da9-de24-80a4-b1e5-da99aecc084a" class="">CI/CD(continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)</h1><p id="17548da9-de24-80d4-a5e3-cb601d7253f6" class="">CI/CD is crucial because it automates the process of web development, from coding to all the way up to deployment. By continuous integration and deployment, code is automatically tested against the pre-defined test-cases. If code fails against the tests, the continuous process will be halted and developer will be notified of the situation. Developers, then can resolve the issue and commit the changes. There are several CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Github Actions, CircleCI that you can use to automate your workflow.</p></div></article><span class="sans" style="font-size:14px;padding-top:2em"></span></body></html>
